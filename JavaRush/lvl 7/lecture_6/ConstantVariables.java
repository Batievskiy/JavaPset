/* what is constant variables?
 * variable whose value cannot change once it has been assigned
 * we write constants in capital letters to differentiate them from ordinary variables
 * if you try to change the constant in the program, compiler sends an error
 * constant variable can make primitive data type immutable of unchangeable
 * We use constants to make the program easy and understandable
