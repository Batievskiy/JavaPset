    Several characteristics that are important elements
    of object-oriented programming:

    Divide and Conquer Principle.
    There is a division of labor at work.
    A very complicated and complex transaction
    has been divided into smaller, more manageable tasks.
    This divide-and-conquer approach is an important
    problem-solving strategy as well as an important element
    in designing object-oriented programs.

    Encapsulation Principle.
    Each agent encapsulates the expertise needed
    to perform a certain task.
    Each agent involved in this complicated transaction
    is an expert in one aspect of the overall process.
    In addition to knowing how to perform the task,
    each agent knows exactly what information
    is required for the task, and exactly what information needs
    to be passed on to the next agent.

    Interface Principle.
    In order for agents to work cooperatively and efficiently,
    we have to clarify exactly how they should interact,
    or interface, with one another.
    This is called the interface principle.
    For example, the interface to the delivery dispatcher
    in our transaction might be a particular paper
    form that must be filled in.
    Once the form is properly filled in,
    the dispatcher can perform the task.

    Information Hiding Principle.
    The work that each agent performs is hidden from the other agents.
    The sales agent knows what information to pass to the warehouse
    clerk but does not know exactly what the warehouse clerk does
    with the information.

    Generality Principle.
    As long as we are designing an object to solve a problem,
    we might as well do it in a general way
    so that the object can be used in any situation
    that requires its expertise. In other words,
    we design objects not for a particular task,
    but rather for a particular kind of task.

    Extensibility Principle.
    One of the strengths of the object-oriented approach
    is the extensibility of objects.
    This too has its analogue in the everyday world.
    Once an agent acquires expertise in a given task,
    it is not difficult to extend the agent's expertise
    to accomplish a related task.
