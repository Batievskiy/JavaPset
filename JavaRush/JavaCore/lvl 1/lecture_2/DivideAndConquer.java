    Divide and Conquer Principle.
    There is a division of labor at work.
    A very complicated and complex transaction
    has been divided into smaller, more manageable tasks.
    This divide-and-conquer approach
    - is an important problem-solving strategy
    as well as an important element
    in designing object-oriented programs.

    Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm.
    A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm
    solves a problem using following three steps:
    1. Divide: Break the given problem
       into sub-problems of same type.
    2. Conquer: Recursively solve these sub-problems.
    3. Combine: Appropriately combine the answers.
