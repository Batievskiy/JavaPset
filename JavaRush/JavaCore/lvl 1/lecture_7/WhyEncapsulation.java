    Why Encapsulation?

    - Better control of class attributes and methods.
    - Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method),
      or write-only (if you only use the set method).
    - Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code
      without affecting other parts.
    - Increased security of data
