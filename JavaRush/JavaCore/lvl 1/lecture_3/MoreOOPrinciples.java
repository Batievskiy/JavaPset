    The Proximity Principle
    The principle of proximity focuses on how well organized your code
    is with respect to readability and change.
    Proximity implies that functions that are changed together
    are moved closer together.
    Proximity is both a design principle and a heuristic
    for refactoring hotspots toward code that's easier to understand.

    The Gestalt law of proximity states:
    - that "objects or shapes that are close to one another
    appear to form groups".
    Even if the shapes, sizes, and objects are radically different,
    they will appear as a group if they are close.


    Common Closure Principle
    - Classes within a released component should share common closure.
    That is, if one needs to be changed,
    they all are likely to need to be changed.

    - Common Closure Principle is the proximity principleâ€”but backward.
    It's hard to apply and often leads to overcomplicated code.
    Instead of planning what will change with what,
    it's better to watch it after some passes and refactor.


    The Single-Responsibility Principle
    - every class in a computer program should have responsibility
    over a single part of that program's functionality,
    which it should encapsulate.
    All of that module, class or function's services
    should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.


    Chunking
    Humans learn (and get mastery) thanks to the process called chunking.
    In cognitive psychology, chunking is a process
    by which individual pieces of an information set
    are broken down and then grouped together.
    A chunk is a collection of basic familiar units
    that have been grouped together and stored in a person's memory.
